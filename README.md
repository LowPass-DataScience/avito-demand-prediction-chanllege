# Python Code for the Avito Demand Prediction Challenge on Kaggle
Our team's final ranking can be found on [Kaggle Competition Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction/leaderboard). We ranked at 205th out of a total of 1917 teams (**top 11%**) with about two weeks of effort, not bad for our first team Kaggle challenge under such a short period of time. 

We have detailed our workflow on the [Readme document](https://github.com/LowPass-DataScience/avito-demand-prediction-chanllege/tree/master/avito-demand-prediction-challenge) for sharing and future references.
